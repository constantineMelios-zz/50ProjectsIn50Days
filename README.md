### *Day 3 - Rotating Navigation*
I did not like that the circle disappeared when the screen was scrolled so I added a scroll bar to the content to fix that. It's not ideal but i like it more!

I smoothened the edges. I added functionality for Enter key the input, and close search when user clicks elsewhere on screen.
