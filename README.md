# 50 Projects In 50 Days

I took the challenge to create 50 Front End projects with HTML, CSS & JS in 50 days. 
Following along this course https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/

### *Day 1 - Expanding Cards*
I created some expanding cards with flexbox and CSS transitions. I also added keyboard access to tab the cards and expand them.

I created some progress steps with CSS transitions.

### *Day 3 - Rotating Navigation*
I did not like that the circle disappeared when the screen was scrolled so I added a scroll bar to the content to fix that. It's not ideal but i like it more!
